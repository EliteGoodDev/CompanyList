## Reason for making this sheet 🤔
A few months ago when I was desperately looking for an internship, a friend of mine suggested me to create a company list and start cold emailing the recruiters of those companies. 
So, I created a doc and gathered all the information about the product based companies that hire for Software Engineering roles. Things did change for me after this sheet. I was able to interview 
with various companies like Yellow Messenger, Spyne AI, Netomi, and recieved test link for companies such as Cred, Sharechat, American Express, and so on. Even if you don't get the opportunity, you will have a solid network of recruiters.

## How to contact the recruiter 🗣
Suppose you want to connect with recruiters of Sharechat so these are steps which I used to follow:
<ol> 
  <li> Search Recruiter/Talent Acquistion/HR on linkedIn with the company tag as Sharechat 👀</li>
  <li> Send them a personal invite with a message that I am looking for opportunities as an XYZ Intern and would love to talk about open roles with you 💬</li>
  <li> If possible then send them en email wih your resume 📧</li>
  <li> Repeat the above 2 steps with atleast 5-10 recruiters 🔁 </li>
  <li> Wait for them to accept your request and then talk to them about open roles. You just need a reply from one recruiter 😎</li>
</ol>

## Usage ⭐️
Feel free to update this sheet and add details such as CTC and internship stipend as well. I hope this sheet will be helpful to others. Please share this sheet among your peers and do give it a star ⭐️
